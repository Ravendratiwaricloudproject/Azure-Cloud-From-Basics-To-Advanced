# Steps to Create an Azure Account
1. Open your browser
   Search for "Microsoft Azure" and press Enter.
2. Visit the Microsoft Azure website
3. Start with a free account
   Click on "Try Azure for free" to create a free account.
   Note: If you want to create a paid account, click on "Pay as you go". This option will be chargeable.
   For learning purposes, I recommend using the free account.
   Click "Start free".
4. Sign in or sign up for a Microsoft account
   If you already have a Microsoft account, sign in using your credentials.
   If you don’t have a Microsoft account, click "Create one" to register a new account.
   Enter your email address and create a password.
   You can also sign in using a GitHub account if you have one.
5. Agree to terms and conditions
   Check the box to agree to the terms and conditions.
   Note: With the free account, you will get 13,300 credits valid for 1 month. You can use this credit within one month. After that, the account must be converted to Pay-as
   you-go, and all resources will become chargeable.

6. Click Next.
7. Provide account details
   You will need to enter:
   Name
   Phone number
   Address
   Credit/Debit card details
   Azure requires a card for verification, but you won’t be charged unless you exceed the free credits or switch to a Pay-as-you-go plan.
   Click Next after entering your details.

8. Accept agreements and sign up
   Agree to the first agreement and click Next.
   Click Sign up to complete registration.
9. Access the Azure portal
    Click on Go to Azure Portal. This will take you to your Azure portal dashboard.
   
11. Explore Azure
    Click on "Microsoft Azure" to access the landing page. Now you can start exploring Azure services.
