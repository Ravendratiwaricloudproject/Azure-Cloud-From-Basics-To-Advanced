# Azure Resource Manager (ARM)

 ARM is the deployment and management service for Azure. It provides a consistent way to manage resources.

Key Features:

Template-Based Deployment: Use JSON templates to define and deploy resources consistently.

Dependency Management: ARM handles dependencies automatically, deploying resources in the correct order.

Rollback/Roll-forward: Automatically revert or update deployments if something goes wrong.

Tagging & Categorization: Organize resources for easier management.

Note: Understanding ARM, resources, and resource groups is fundamental to managing Azure efficiently.

# Resource Groups
Logical containers where you deploy and manage Azure resources like virtual machines, databases, web apps, and storage accounts.

Simplified: Resource groups are basically a grouping of resources for easier management.

Why it matters: Makes it easier to organize, monitor, and control access to related resources.

# Resources
Think of resources in Azure as individual pieces or instances of the services you use. each Azure resource serves a specific purpose, such as storing data, running applications, or managing networks.

Like virtual machines, app services, storage accounts, SQL databases, function apps, etc. All these are azure services.
And what you create using these services is called resources.
