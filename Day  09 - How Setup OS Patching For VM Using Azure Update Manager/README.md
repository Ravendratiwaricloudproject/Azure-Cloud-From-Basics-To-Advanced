# What is Azure Update Manager?
Azure Update Manager is a centralized Microsoft Azure service for managing software updates across Windows and Linux virtual machines, providing a single dashboard for monitoring compliance and deploying OS patches for servers in Azure, on-premises, and other clouds (via Azure Arc).
It offers flexible options like real-time updates, scheduled maintenance windows, and automatic updates.

# What is OS patching?

OS patching is the process of installing updates (patches) released by an operating system vendor (such as Microsoft Windows or Linux distributors) to fix issues and improve the system.

OS patches typically include:

Security updates – fix vulnerabilities that could be exploited

Bug fixes – resolve system errors or stability issues

Performance improvements – optimize system behavior

Feature updates – add or enhance OS capabilities

# Why OS is patching needed?

OS patching is required for several reasons:

1. Security: Protects systems from known vulnerabilities and cyberattacks. Reduces the risk of malware, ransomware, and unauthorized access.

2. Stability & Reliability: Fixes bugs that may cause crashes or system failures and Ensures applications run smoothly.

3. Compliance: Required for many standards (ISO, SOC, PCI-DSS, etc.). Helps meet organizational and regulatory requirements.

4. Performance: Improves OS efficiency and resource usage.

5. Supportability: Keeps systems within vendor-supported versions. Ensures compatibility with newer applications and services.

 # In short: OS patching keeps systems secure, stable, compliant, and up to date.
